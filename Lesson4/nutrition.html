    <h3>Food for Thought</h3>
    <img src="img/nutrition1.jpg" alt="nutrition1" />
    <p>
      Good nutrition is a lifestyle, not a diet. It starts with a new way of
      thinking about food. Think of your body as a vehicle that uses food for
      fuel. Fill your tank with the right type of fuel.<br /><br />
      Do not approach your nutrition plan as a diet plan, but rather, a
      lifestyle change. If you make a permanent change, you will see big
      results. The key to success is a daily focus on your goal.<br /><br />
      Portion your meals and track your calories. There are many free mobile
      apps available to help track your activity level and calories.<br /><br />
      Control impulsive urges to buy junk food, and instead, allow yourself to
      one "cheat" meal a week.<br /><br />

    <h3>What to Eat</h3>
    <img src="img/nutrition2.jpg" alt="nutrition2" />
    <p>Use the following as a guideline:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Protein, such as eggs, chicken, and lean red meat</li>
      <li>Vegetables, but avoid corn and peas</li>
      <li>Fruit</li>
      <li>Fat, such as olive oil, nuts, and seeds</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Limit the consumption of bread, pasta, white potatoes, and processed food.
      These foods are high in carbohydrates.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you shop for groceries, shop the outside aisles and buy organic when
      possible. Stock up on fresh vegetables, almond flour, and flax seed.
